A Machine Learning model for possible job losses caused by AI adoption in a work environment
Data Acquisition & Justification

AI has transformed industries by automating tasks once perfomed by humans. The rapid adoption of AI threatens to automate tasks across many occupations, leading to potential widespread job displacement or transformation. To create a predictive model that identifies workers and demographic groups facing the highest susceptibility to automation. The model's output informs targeted government intervention such as vocational training, education reform, or social safety net expansion before major job losses occur.

Understanding the Task: Predicting Risk

The challenge in predicting "job loss" is the lack of historical data explicitly labeled with "AI caused job loss." Therefore, the task is reframed from predicting a direct outcome to predicting exposure and susceptibility.

Data Understanding & Preprocessing

After acquiring my dataset from Kaggle, link :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahilislam007/ai-impact-on-job-market-20242030 I began by loading and inspecting it to understand the structure, key features, and potential issues such as missing or inconsistent values. My goal at this stage was to get a sense of the dataâ€™s shape, data types, and distribution of the target variable that indicates job loss risk.
